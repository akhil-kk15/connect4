Connect 4 Game
Welcome to Connect 4! This is a digital version of the classic board game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a 6x7 grid to try and get four of their discs in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
How to Play
Installation: No installation is required for this game. Simply ensure you have a compatible web browser and access to the game's website.
Game Setup:
Launch the game by accessing the game's website.
Choose the game mode: You can either play against another human player or against the computer.
Select your desired color: Each player must choose a color (either red or green) to represent their discs in the game.
Gameplay:
The game will display a 6x7 grid representing the game board. Each column is labeled with a number from 1 to 7.
The first player (or the player who starts) will be displayed on the screen.
To make a move, enter the number of the column where you want to drop your disc.
The game will validate your move and update the game board accordingly.
Players take turns dropping their discs until one player gets four of their discs in a row or the game board is completely filled.
Winning the Game:
If a player gets four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), the game will automatically stop.
The winning player's name will be displayed on the screen, along with a congratulatory message.
At this point, the game is over and players can choose to restart the game or exit.
Restarting the Game:
After the game ends, you will be prompted with an option to restart the game.
If you choose to restart, the game board will be cleared, and a new game will begin with the same settings.

If you wish to exit the game at any point, simply close the web browser or navigate away from the game's website.
